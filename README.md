Control your Rixens heating system from your phone, tablet, or any Home
Assistant dashboard. Set temperatures, switch between heat sources, and get
alerts — all without walking to the thermostat.

## Features

Once installed, you get full control of your Rixens heater right from Home
Assistant:

| What you can do                       | How                                                              |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Set your desired temperature (5-35°C) | Climate card or thermostat entity                                |
| Turn the heater on or off             | Climate card power button                                        |
| Switch between heat sources           | Furnace, Electric Heat, and Floor Heat switches                  |
| Control the fan                       | Auto mode or manual speed (10-100%)                              |
| Use quick presets                     | Away (freeze protection), Home, or Sleep                         |
| Monitor room conditions               | Temperature and humidity sensors                                 |
| Track heater diagnostics              | Battery voltage, flame temp, fuel consumption, runtime, and more |
| Check connectivity                    | Connection status binary sensor                                  |

All temperature values automatically display in your preferred units (Celsius or
Fahrenheit) based on your Home Assistant settings.

## Setting Up Presets

Customize the preset temperatures to match your comfort preferences:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Devices & Services**
2. Find the **Rixens** integration and click **Configure**
3. Adjust the preset temperatures:
   - **Away** — Freeze protection (default: 10°C)
   - **Home** — Comfortable living (default: 20°C)
   - **Sleep** — Night time (default: 18°C)
4. Click **Submit** — changes apply immediately, no restart needed

## Automation Ideas

Home Assistant lets you automate your heating based on schedules, location,
sensors, and more. You can create automations using the visual editor in
**Settings** > **Automations & Scenes** — no YAML required. Below are a few
ideas with YAML examples for reference.

### Freeze Protection When You Leave

Automatically set Away mode when you've been gone for 30 minutes, keeping your
RV above freezing without wasting fuel.

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "RV Freeze Protection"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: person.your_name
        from: "home"
        to: "not_home"
        for: "00:30:00"
    action:
      - service: climate.set_preset_mode
        target:
          entity_id: climate.rixens_heater
        data:
          preset_mode: "away"
```

### Low Battery Alert

Get a phone notification when your RV battery drops below 12V so you can plug in
before it's too late.

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "RV Low Battery Alert"
    trigger:
      - platform: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.rixens_heater_battery_voltage
        below: 12.0
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "Low RV Battery"
          message:
            "Battery voltage is {{
            states('sensor.rixens_heater_battery_voltage') }}V"
```

### Switch to Electric Heat on Shore Power

Save fuel by automatically switching to electric heat when you plug into shore
power.

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Use Electric Heat on Shore Power"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.shore_power # Your shore power sensor
        to: "on"
    condition:
      - condition: state
        entity_id: climate.rixens_heater
        state: "heat"
    action:
      - service: switch.turn_off
        target:
          entity_id: switch.rixens_heater_furnace
      - service: switch.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: switch.rixens_heater_electric_heat
```

### Pre-Heat Before You Arrive

Use geofencing to start heating your RV as you approach — walk into a warm
space.

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Pre-Heat RV on Approach"
    trigger:
      - platform: zone
        entity_id: person.your_name
        zone: zone.rv_location
        event: enter
    action:
      - service: climate.set_preset_mode
        target:
          entity_id: climate.rixens_heater
        data:
          preset_mode: "home"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Device not responding?

- Make sure the heater is powered on and connected to WiFi
- Try visiting `http://<your-device-ip>/status.xml` in a browser — you should
  see XML data
- Make sure Home Assistant and the Rixens device are on the same network

### Sensors showing "Unavailable"?

- Check the **Connection** binary sensor
  (`binary_sensor.rixens_heater_connection`) to see if the device is reachable
- The integration automatically retries failed connections and keeps the last
  known data for about 50 seconds during brief network hiccups
- If sensors stay unavailable, check your Home Assistant logs for error details

### Updates seem slow?

- The integration polls your device every 5 seconds by default
- Slow updates usually indicate network latency — check your WiFi signal at the
  device

### Still stuck?

- Search existing
  [issues](https://github.com/crbn60/ha-rixens-integration/issues) — someone may
  have had the same problem
- Open a [new issue](https://github.com/crbn60/ha-rixens-integration/issues/new)
  with your Home Assistant version, integration version, and relevant logs
